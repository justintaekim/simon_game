## Implemented the Simon Game using basic HTML CSS and JS.

The Simon Game is an electronic memory game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in the late 1970s. It became popular during the 1980s and remains a classic game today. The objective of the Simon Game is to follow a sequence of randomly generated tones and lights and replicate that sequence accurately.

The game consists of a small electronic device with four different colored buttons, typically green, red, blue, and yellow. Each button corresponds to a specific tone and light. The device will play a sequence of tones and light up the corresponding buttons in a particular order. The player's task is to observe and remember the sequence, and then reproduce it by pressing the buttons in the same order.

The game starts with a simple sequence of only one tone and button press. After successfully replicating the sequence, the game progressively adds one more element to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging. The game continues in this manner, testing the player's memory and concentration as the sequences become more complex.

The Simon Game is not only entertaining but also helps improve memory, focus, and pattern recognition skills. It can be played individually or competitively among multiple players, taking turns to replicate and extend the sequences.
